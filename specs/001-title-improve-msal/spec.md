# Feature Specification: Improve MSAL module version checking to be more permissive

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-improve-msal`  
**Created**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Make MSAL module version checking more permissive for minor and patch versions"
**Issue**: https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/issues/3375

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Fusion Framework MSAL module, I want the version checking to be more permissive so that my application doesn't fail when different parts use slightly different minor or patch versions of the MSAL module.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an application using MSAL module version 4.0.7, **When** the latest available version is 4.0.9, **Then** the application should work without errors
2. **Given** an application using MSAL module version 4.1.0, **When** the latest available version is 4.0.9, **Then** the application should show a warning but continue to work
3. **Given** an application using MSAL module version 5.0.0, **When** the latest available version is 4.0.9, **Then** the application should throw an error due to major version incompatibility
4. **Given** different parts of a monorepo using different patch versions of MSAL, **When** they interact, **Then** they should work together without version conflicts

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the requested version is exactly the same as the latest version?
- How does the system handle invalid version strings?
- What happens when the latest version cannot be determined?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST only block execution when requested major version is greater than latest major version
- **FR-002**: System MUST show warning messages when minor versions differ but allow execution to continue
- **FR-003**: System MUST skip version checks entirely for patch version differences
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing MSAL module configurations
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear error messages for major version incompatibilities
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide informative warning messages for minor version differences
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle invalid version strings gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Key Entities
- **Version Checker**: Component responsible for comparing requested and available versions
- **Version Warning**: Notification system that alerts users about minor version differences
- **Version Error**: Error system that blocks execution for major version incompatibilities
