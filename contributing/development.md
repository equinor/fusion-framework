# Development

This document describes the process for running this application on your local computer.

## Getting started

It runs on macOS, Linux environments (should work on windows).

> none of the developers nor our workflows run windows, we encourage running [windows subsystem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).
>
> if your a windows user and has a MS inter-opt fix, we welcome PR`s 😇 

You'll need Node.js to run the site. Check the version in `package.json`. To install Node.js, [download the "LTS" installer from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). If you're using [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv), read the [`nodenv` docs](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#readme) for instructions on switching Node.js versions.

Once you've installed Node.js (which includes the popular `npm` package manager), open Terminal and run the following:

```sh
  # clone repo
  git clone https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework
  # install packages
  pnpm install
  # build all packages
  pnpm build
```
