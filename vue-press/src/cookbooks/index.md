# Cookbooks

Welcome to the Fusion Framework cookbooks! These example applications demonstrate how to use the framework and its modules in real-world scenarios.

## What are Cookbooks?

Cookbooks are **complete, working examples** that show you how to implement specific features or patterns with the Fusion Framework. They serve multiple purposes:

- **Learning Resources** - Understand how to use framework features through working examples
- **Reference Implementations** - See best practices for common use cases and patterns
- **Starting Templates** - Use them as a foundation for your own applications
- **Integration Tests** - Validate that framework components work together correctly

::: tip Keep it simple
Cookbooks follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) - they contain only the necessary code to demonstrate a specific scenario with clear, helpful comments.

## Available Cookbooks

### React Applications

Our React cookbooks demonstrate how to build applications using the Fusion Framework with React:

- **[MSAL Authentication](react-app-msal.md)** - Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL v4) integration with Azure AD
- **Basic React App** - Foundation for React applications
- **AG Grid** - Data tables and grids integration
- **App Loader** - Application loading patterns and strategies
- **Assets** - Static asset management and loading
- **Bookmarks** - Bookmark functionality with persistence
- **Advanced Bookmarks** - Multi-page bookmark features with routing
- **Charts** - Data visualization and chart components
- **Context** - Shared context usage patterns
- **Custom Error Handling** - Error boundaries and custom error contexts
- **Environment Variables** - Configuration management with environment variables
- **Feature Flags** - Feature toggle implementation
- **Custom Modules** - Creating and integrating custom modules
- **People Service** - People search and person component integration
- **Router** - Client-side routing and navigation
- **Settings** - Application settings management

### Other Examples

- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Framework usage without React
- **Portal** - Portal framework demonstration
- **POC Portal** - Proof of concept portal application

## Getting Started

To run any cookbook:

```bash
# Navigate to the cookbook directory
cd cookbooks/app-react-msal

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pn high dev
```

Most cookbooks run on `http://localhost:3000` by default. Check the terminal output for the exact URL.

## Using Cookbooks in Your Projects

### As Learning Examples

Each cookbook focuses on a specific feature or pattern. Browse the code to understand how the framework is used:

1. Check the main `App.tsx` component
2. Review the `config.ts` for framework configuration
3. Examine the `package.json` for dependencies
4. Read the cookbook-specific README for detailed explanations

### As Starting Templates

To start a new project from a cookbook:

```bash
# Copy an existing cookbook as your template
cp -r cookbooks/app-react-my-feature cookbooks/my-new-app

# Update package.json with your app name
# Update configuration files as needed
```

### Finding the Right Cookbook

- **New to Fusion Framework?** Start with the basic React app cookbook
- **Need authentication?** Check the MSAL cookbook
- **Building a data table?** Look at the AG Grid cookbook
- **Adding routing?** See the Router cookbook

## Cookbook Structure

A typical cookbook follows this structure:

```
cookbooks/your-cookbook/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts          # Application entry point
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx           # Main React component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.ts         # Framework configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...               # Feature-specific files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json          # Package configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # Cookbook documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.config.ts         # App manifest (optional)
```
