# Changeset Generation Rules (Cursor delegation)

This rule intentionally delegates to the **GitHub-based instructions** to avoid duplication.

For complete and authoritative changeset guidance, follow:

- `.github/instructions/changesets.instructions.md`
- `AGENT.md` (sections: **Instruction hierarchy** and **Key instruction files**)

AI agents should read and follow those files directly when creating or editing changesets.
