# TypeScript Documentation Rules (Cursor delegation)

This rule intentionally delegates to the **GitHub-based instructions** to avoid duplication.

For TSDoc, inline comments, and general TypeScript documentation practices, follow:

- `.github/instructions/code-generation.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/react.instructions.md` (for React components and hooks)
- `AGENT.md` (sections: **What you are working with** and **Default behavior checklist**)

AI agents should use those files as the source of truth for documentation expectations.
