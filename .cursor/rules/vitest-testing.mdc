# Vitest Testing Rules (Cursor delegation)

This rule intentionally delegates to the **GitHub-based instructions** to avoid duplication.

For testing structure, coverage expectations, mocking, and async/error testing, follow:

- `.github/instructions/testing.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/react.instructions.md` (for React component tests)
- `AGENT.md` (sections: **Key instruction files** and **Default behavior checklist**)

AI agents should treat those documents as the single source of truth for testing behavior.
