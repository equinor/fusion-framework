# Monorepo Package Resolution Rules (Cursor delegation)

This rule intentionally delegates to the **GitHub-based instructions** to avoid duplication.

For monorepo layout, import patterns, and cross-package dependency rules, follow:

- `.github/instructions/monorepo-structure.instructions.md`
- `AGENT.md` (sections: **What you are working with** and **Key instruction files**)

AI agents should treat those files as the single source of truth for monorepo behavior.
