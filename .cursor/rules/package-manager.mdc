# Package Manager Rules (Cursor delegation)

This rule intentionally delegates to the **GitHub-based instructions** to avoid duplication.

For package manager and workspace command usage, follow:

- `.github/instructions/code-generation.instructions.md` (section: **Package Manager**)
- `AGENT.md` (sections: **What you are working with** and **Default behavior checklist**)

AI agents should always use `pnpm` (never `npm` or `yarn`) and follow those documents for command patterns.
