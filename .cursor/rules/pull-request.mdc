# Pull Request Generation Rules (Cursor delegation)

This rule intentionally delegates to the **GitHub-based instructions** to avoid duplication.

For PR templates, titles, bodies, and review flow, follow:

- `.github/instructions/pull-requests.instructions.md`
- `AGENT.md` (sections: **Key instruction files** and **Default behavior checklist**)

AI agents should always use the GitHub PR template and those docs when generating or editing PR content.
