# Pull Request Generation Rules

## Always Use GitHub PR Template

When generating pull request titles and bodies, **always** use the repository's GitHub PR template located at [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](mdc:.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Template Structure Requirements

The PR template includes these required sections that must be filled:

### Why Section
- **What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (e.g., feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)
- **What is the current behavior?** (describe existing behavior)
- **What is the new behavior?** (describe what will change)
- **Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (yes/no and explanation)
- **Other information?** (any additional context)
- **closes:** (link to related issues)

### Checkboxes Section
All checkboxes in the template must be addressed:
- [ ] Confirm changes to target branch validation
- [ ] Confirm completion of self-review checklist
- [ ] Confirm adherence to code of conduct

## PR Title Format
Follow conventional commit format for PR titles when possible:
- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: resolve issue`
- `refactor: improve code structure`
- `docs: update documentation`
- `chore: maintenance tasks`

## Best Practices
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include relevant issue numbers
- Reference any breaking changes clearly
- Explain the rationale behind changes
- Link to related PRs or issues
