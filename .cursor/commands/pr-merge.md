# PR Merge Command

## Overview
Automated PR merging tool that handles the complete workflow from listing PRs to merging and cleanup. Ensures code quality through validation and maintains clean git history with squashing.

## Prerequisites
- **pnpm** must be available (not npm)
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh` command) must be installed
- **Current directory**: Must be in the fusion-framework repository root
- **Node.js and TypeScript** environment
- **Write permissions** to the repository

## Command Formatting Guidelines
- **Always use backticks** for GitHub CLI commands: `` `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER]` ``
- **Multi-line commands** use backslash continuation: `` `gh api \` ``
- **Consistent placeholders**: Use `[PR_NUMBER]` not `<PULL_NUMBER>`
- **Code blocks** for command examples: ```bash ... ```
- **Escape backticks in body content**: Use `` \` `` inside `--body` parameters

## Detailed Workflow Steps

### 0. Optional: Direct PR Input (Skip Step 1)
**USAGE**: If you already know the PR number or URL, you can skip the listing step.

**ACCEPTED INPUTS**:
- PR number: `1234` or `#1234`
- PR URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/1234`
- Full PR URL: `https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/pull/1234`

**VALIDATION**:
1. Extract PR number from input
2. Verify PR exists: `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json number,title,author,state,mergeable`
3. Confirm PR is open: Check `state` equals `"OPEN"`
4. Confirm PR is mergeable: Check `mergeable` equals `true`

**IF VALID**: Proceed directly to step 2 (Checkout PR)
**IF INVALID**: Fall back to step 1 (List Available PRs)

**USAGE EXAMPLES**:
```bash
# Using PR number
/pr-merge 1234

# Using PR number with hash
/pr-merge #1234

# Using full GitHub URL
/pr-merge https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/pull/1234
```

**ERROR HANDLING**:
- **Invalid PR number**: "PR #1234 not found or not accessible"
- **PR is closed**: "PR #1234 is not open (state: CLOSED/MERGED)"
- **PR not mergeable**: "PR #1234 is not mergeable (mergeable: false)"
- **Invalid URL format**: "Invalid PR URL format. Expected: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/1234"

### 1. List Available PRs
**COMMAND**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author,createdAt,mergeable`

**FILTERING**:
- **Default**: Only show mergeable PRs (`--jq '.[] | select(.mergeable == true)'`)
- **Include all**: Use `--include-all` flag to show non-mergeable PRs

**OUTPUT FORMAT**: Display PRs with emoji prefixes:
```
üöÄ PR #XXXX: [title] by @author (created X days ago) ‚úÖ mergeable
üêõ PR #YYYY: [title] by @author (created X days ago) ‚úÖ mergeable
üìö PR #ZZZZ: [title] by @author (created X days ago) ‚úÖ mergeable
üîß PR #AAAA: [title] by @author (created X days ago) ‚úÖ mergeable
‚ö° PR #BBBB: [title] by @author (created X days ago) ‚úÖ mergeable
‚ö†Ô∏è PR #CCCC: [title] by @author (created X days ago) ‚ùå conflicts
üö´ PR #DDDD: [title] by @author (created X days ago) ‚ùå blocked
```

**EMOJI LEGEND**:
- üöÄ **Feature** - New features and enhancements
- üêõ **Bug Fix** - Bug fixes and patches
- üìö **Documentation** - Documentation updates
- üîß **Refactor** - Code refactoring and improvements
- ‚ö° **Performance** - Performance optimizations
- üé® **Style** - Code style and formatting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Conflicts** - Has merge conflicts
- üö´ **Blocked** - Blocked or not mergeable

**IMPORTANT RULES**:
- ‚ùå **Do NOT fetch detailed information** - only show the basic list
- ‚ùå **Do NOT run `gh pr view` commands** - wait for user selection
- ‚úÖ **Wait for user to select** which PR to merge
- ‚úÖ **Then checkout** using `gh pr checkout [PR_NUMBER]`

### 2. Checkout PR
**COMMAND**: `gh pr checkout [PR_NUMBER]`

**VALIDATION**:
1. Verify checkout was successful
2. Confirm we're on the correct branch
3. Check if branch is up to date with origin

**IF CHECKOUT FAILS**:
- Check if PR exists and is accessible
- Verify branch permissions
- Try fetching latest changes: `git fetch origin`

**SUCCESS MESSAGE**:
```
‚úÖ Successfully checked out PR #[PR_NUMBER]
üìç Current branch: [branch-name]
```

### 3. Rebase to Main
**REBASE PROCESS**:

1. **Fetch latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Rebase onto main**:
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

3. **Handle conflicts** (if any):
   - **If conflicts occur**: Ask user: "Rebase conflicts detected. Should I help resolve them? (y/n)"
   - **If user confirms**: Guide through conflict resolution
   - **If user says no**: Abort rebase and ask for manual resolution

4. **Update lock file** (if conflicts in package files):
   ```bash
   # If package.json or pnpm-lock.yaml conflicts
   pnpm install
   git add pnpm-lock.yaml
   git rebase --continue
   ```

**CONFLICT RESOLUTION GUIDE**:
```bash
# When conflicts occur:
1. Check conflicted files: git status
2. Resolve conflicts in your editor
3. Stage resolved files: git add <file>
4. Continue rebase: git rebase --continue
5. Repeat until rebase completes
```

**SUCCESS MESSAGE**:
```
‚úÖ Successfully rebased PR #[PR_NUMBER] onto main
üìç Branch is now up to date with main
```

**ERROR HANDLING**:
- **Rebase conflicts**: Guide user through resolution or abort

‚úÖ Admin approval comment posted
üìù PR marked as admin tested and ready for merge
```

### 8. Merge PR
**MERGE PROCESS**:

1. **Check PR status**:
   ```bash
   gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus
   ```

2. **Merge PR with squash**:
   ```bash
   gh pr merge [PR_NUMBER] --squash --delete-branch
   ```

3. **Verify merge success**:
   ```bash
   gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json state
   ```

**MERGE OPTIONS**:
- `--squash`: Squash all commits into a single commit
- `--delete-branch`: Automatically delete the PR branch after merge
- `--merge`: Use merge commit (alternative to squash)
- `--rebase`: Use rebase merge (alternative to squash)

**DECISION POINT**:
- **Before merging**: Ask user: "Ready to merge PR #[PR_NUMBER] with squash? This will close the PR. Continue? (y/n)"
- **If user confirms**: Proceed with merge
- **If user says no**: Abort merge process

**SUCCESS MESSAGE**:
```
‚úÖ PR #[PR_NUMBER] merged successfully
üîÄ Commits squashed into single commit
üóëÔ∏è PR branch deleted automatically
```

### 9. Delete Local Branch
**CLEANUP PROCESS**:

1. **Switch to main branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Update main branch**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Delete local branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch -d [branch-name]
   ```

4. **Clean up remote tracking**:
   ```bash
   git remote prune origin
   ```

**NOTE**: The remote branch is automatically deleted by `gh pr merge --delete-branch`, so we only need to clean up the local branch.

**DECISION POINT**:
- **Before cleanup**: Ask user: "Ready to delete local branch [branch-name]? (y/n)"
- **If user confirms**: Proceed with cleanup
- **If user says no**: Skip cleanup

**SUCCESS MESSAGE**:
```
‚úÖ Local branch [branch-name] deleted
üßπ Cleanup completed
```

## Best Practices

### Before Merging
- [ ] Ensure PR has been reviewed and approved
- [ ] Verify all CI checks are passing
- [ ] Check that PR is mergeable
- [ ] Confirm no breaking changes without migration guides

### During Merging
- [ ] Always rebase onto latest main
- [ ] Resolve conflicts carefully
- [ ] Run full validation suite
- [ ] Use GitHub's squash merge for clean history

### After Merging
- [ ] Clean up local branches
- [ ] Update main branch
- [ ] Verify merge was successful
- [ ] Monitor for any issues

## Safety Features

- **Force push with lease**: Prevents accidental overwrites
- **User confirmation**: All destructive actions require confirmation
- **Conflict resolution**: Guided help for rebase conflicts
- **Validation checks**: Multiple quality gates before merge
- **Rollback capability**: Ability to abort at any step
