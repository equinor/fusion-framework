# PR Review Command

## Overview
Comprehensive automated PR review tool that analyzes code changes, validates functionality, and provides constructive feedback. Supports both interactive PR selection and direct PR input via number or URL.

## Prerequisites
- **pnpm** must be available (not npm)
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh` command) must be installed
- **Current directory**: Must be in the fusion-framework repository root
- **Node.js and TypeScript** environment

## Command Formatting Guidelines
- **Always use backticks** for GitHub CLI commands: `` `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER]` ``
- **Multi-line commands** use backslash continuation: `` `gh api \` ``
- **Consistent placeholders**: Use `[PR_NUMBER]` not `<PULL_NUMBER>`
- **Code blocks** for command examples: ```bash ... ```
- **Escape backticks in body content**: Use `` \` `` inside `--body` parameters
- **Example**: `--body "## Code Example \`const foo = 1\`"`
- **For line comments with diffs**: Escape backticks in code blocks
- **Example**: `-f body="\`\`\`diff\n- const foo = 123\n+ const foo = 321\n\`\`\`"`

**ü§î User Confirmation**: At each decision point, always ask user for confirmation (y/n) when in doubt

**Key Decision Points:**
- **Step 0 vs 1**: Use direct input if you know the PR number/URL
- **Step 3**: Analyze package impact and breaking changes
- **Step 4**: Validate PR body accuracy and self-review completion
- **Step 5**: Review code quality, documentation, and best practices
- **Step 6**: Validate changeset format and semver
- **Step 7**: Ensure code builds, tests pass, and no errors
- **Step 8**: Provide constructive feedback and make PR decision

**ü§î Always Ask User**: When in doubt about any decision, ask user for confirmation (y/n)

## Detailed Workflow Steps

### 0. Optional: Direct PR Input (Skip Step 1)
**USAGE**: If you already know the PR number or URL, you can skip the listing step.

**ACCEPTED INPUTS**:
- PR number: `1234` or `#1234`
- PR URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/1234`
- Full PR URL: `https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/pull/1234`

**VALIDATION**:
1. Extract PR number from input
2. Verify PR exists: `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json number,title,author,state`
3. Confirm PR is open: Check `state` equals `"OPEN"`

**IF VALID**: Proceed directly to step 2 (Checkout PR)
**IF INVALID**: Fall back to step 1 (List and Select)

**USAGE EXAMPLES**:
```bash
# Using PR number
/pr-review 1234

# Using PR number with hash
/pr-review #1234

# Using full GitHub URL
/pr-review https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/pull/1234
```

**ERROR HANDLING**:
- **Invalid PR number**: "PR #1234 not found or not accessible"
- **PR is closed**: "PR #1234 is not open (state: CLOSED/MERGED)"
- **Invalid URL format**: "Invalid PR URL format. Expected: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/1234"

### 1. List and Select PR
**COMMAND**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author,createdAt`

**FILTERING**:
- **Default**: Exclude dependabot PRs (`--author "!dependabot[bot]"`)
- **Include dependabot**: Use `--include-dependabot` flag

**OUTPUT FORMAT**: Display PRs grouped by type:
```
üöÄ FEATURE PRs
- PR #XXXX: [title] by @author (created X days ago)
- PR #YYYY: [title] by @author (created X days ago)

üêõ BUG FIX PRs  
- PR #ZZZZ: [title] by @author (created X days ago)
- PR #AAAA: [title] by @author (created X days ago)

üìö DOCUMENTATION PRs
- PR #BBBB: [title] by @author (created X days ago)

üîß DEPENDABOT PRs (if --include-dependabot)
- PR #CCCC: [title] by @author (created X days ago)
```

**IMPORTANT RULES**:
- ‚ùå **Do NOT fetch detailed information** - only show the basic list
- ‚ùå **Do NOT run `gh pr view` commands** - wait for user selection
- ‚úÖ **Wait for user to select** which PR to review
- ‚úÖ **Then checkout** using `gh pr checkout [PR_NUMBER]`

### 2. Checkout PR
**COMMAND**: `gh pr checkout [PR_NUMBER]`

**VALIDATION**:
1. Verify checkout was successful
2. Confirm we're on the correct branch
3. Check if branch is up to date with origin

**IF CHECKOUT FAILS**:
- Check if PR exists and is accessible
- Verify branch permissions
- Try fetching latest changes: `git fetch origin`

### 3. Research Impact
**ANALYZE PR CHANGES**: Use `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json title,body,files`

**RESEARCH TASKS**:
1. **Package Analysis**:
   - Check for package.json changes
   - Identify added/removed/updated packages
   - Verify package existence and versions
   - Check for breaking changes in dependencies

2. **Dependency Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Check direct dependencies
   pnpm list --depth=0
   
   # Trace dependency usage
   pnpm why <package-name>
   
   # Check for security vulnerabilities
   pnpm audit
   ```

3. **Changelog Analysis**:
   - Check if packages have changelogs
   - Review release notes for breaking changes
   - Identify new features and bug fixes

4. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Determine which packages will be affected
   - Check for compilation packages that need updates
   - Identify potential breaking changes

**INTERNAL ANALYSIS ONLY**: 
- Document findings internally for use in final review
- Do not post research comments to the PR
- Save analysis results for step 8 (Post Feedback)

### 4. Validate PR Body
**PR BODY VALIDATION**:

1. **Get PR Information**:
   ```bash
   gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json title,body,author
   ```

2. **Validate PR Description**:
   - **Accuracy Check**: Does the PR body accurately describe what the code actually does?
   - **Completeness**: Does it explain the changes, rationale, and impact?
   - **Clarity**: Is the description clear and understandable?

3. **Check for Self-Review**:
   - Look for evidence of self-review in the PR body
   - Check if author has tested their changes
   - Verify if breaking changes are documented
   - Look for migration guides if applicable

4. **Validation Criteria**:
   - **Description Matches Code**: PR body accurately reflects actual changes (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
   - **Self-Review Evidence**: Author has done basic self-review (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
   - **Breaking Changes**: Documented if present (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
   - **Testing**: Evidence of testing or validation (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
   
   **PASS CRITERIA**: All 4 criteria must be ‚úÖ
   **FAIL CRITERIA**: Any criteria is ‚ùå

**DECISION POINT**:
- **If PR body is inadequate**: 
  - Ask user: "PR body is inadequate. Should I reject this PR and ask author to improve it? (y/n)"
  - If user confirms: Post rejection message using the template below and end review
  - If user says no: Continue with code analysis anyway
- **If PR body is good**: Continue with code analysis

**REJECTION MESSAGE** (if PR body is inadequate):
```bash
gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --request-changes --body "## üìù PR Body Needs Improvement

Hey! The code changes look good, but we need a bit more detail in the PR description before we can review it properly.

### What's Working Well

```

**INTERNAL ANALYSIS ONLY**: 
- Document PR body validation findings
- Do not post validation comments to the PR
- Save analysis results for step 8 (Post Feedback)

### 5. Analyze Code
**CODE REVIEW TASKS**:

1. **TypeScript Documentation**:
   - Check for TSDoc comments on exported functions/classes
   - Verify parameter and return type documentation
   - Ensure IntelliSense-friendly documentation

2. **Inline Comments**:
   - Review complex operations for explanatory comments
   - Check for magic numbers and constants
   - Verify side effects are documented

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Check for best practices adherence
   - Review error handling patterns
   - Verify consistent coding style
   - Check for proper type usage

4. **File Analysis**:
   ```bash
   # Get changed files
   gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json files --jq '.files[].path'
   
   # Analyze each changed file
   # Check for proper imports/exports
   # Verify function signatures
   # Review class structures
   ```

**CODE QUALITY CHECKS**:
- **Function Documentation**: All exported functions have TSDoc comments
- **Complex Logic**: Inline comments explain non-obvious operations
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and validation
- **Type Safety**: Correct TypeScript usage
- **Performance**: No obvious performance issues
- **Security**: No security vulnerabilities

**INTERNAL ANALYSIS ONLY**: 
- Document findings internally for use in final review
- Do not post code analysis comments to the PR
- Save analysis results for step 8 (Post Feedback)

### 6. Analyze Changesets
**CHANGESET VALIDATION**:

1. **Check for Changesets**:
   ```bash
   # List changeset files
   ls .changeset/*.md
   
   # Check if changesets exist for affected packages
   ```

2. **Validate Changeset Format**:
   - Check YAML frontmatter structure
   - Verify package names are correct
   - Ensure version types are appropriate (patch/minor/major)

3. **Semantic Versioning**:
   - Verify semver is correctly applied
   - Check if breaking changes have major version bumps
   - Ensure backward compatible changes use patch/minor

4. **Migration Guides**:
   - Check for migration guides on breaking changes
   - Verify migration steps are clear and complete
   - Ensure examples are provided where needed

**CHANGESET REQUIREMENTS**:
- **All affected packages** must have changesets (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- **Breaking changes** require major version bumps (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- **Migration guides** required for breaking changes (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- **Clear descriptions** of what changed and why (‚úÖ/‚ùå)

**PASS CRITERIA**: All 4 requirements must be ‚úÖ
**FAIL CRITERIA**: Any requirement is ‚ùå

**DECISION POINT**:
- **If changesets are inadequate**: 
  - Ask user: "Changesets are inadequate. Should I reject this PR and ask author to fix them? (y/n)"
  - If user confirms: Post rejection message using the template below and end review
  - If user says no: Continue with code validation anyway
- **If changesets are good**: Continue with code validation

**REJECTION MESSAGE** (if changesets are inadequate):
```bash
gh pr review [PR_NUMBER] --request-changes --body "## üìú Changeset Issues Found
