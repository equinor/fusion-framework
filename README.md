# Fusion Framework

Fusion Framework is a modular and extensible framework designed to simplify the development of modern web applications. It provides a set of core modules and utilities that handle common concerns like authentication, HTTP communication, service discovery, and event handling. The framework is built with flexibility in mind, allowing developers to easily configure and extend its functionality to meet their application's needs.

## üöÄ Get Started

The best place to start is by reading through the [documentation](https://equinor.github.io/fusion-framework/) on the core concepts and architecture. The framework is modular, so you can pick and choose which parts to use.

If you're developing an application for the Fusion Portals, check out the [Fusion Docs](https://fusion-docs.fusion-dev.net/docs/i-want-to-create/application/getting-started) for specific requirements and setup.

## üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥ Cookbooks

The [cookbooks](https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/tree/main/cookbooks) directory contains sample applications demonstrating how to implement various features and patterns using the framework. These runnable examples cover topics like:

- Setting up a basic React application
- Integrating routing and navigation
- Managing application state
- Enabling authentication and authorization
- Consuming APIs and services
- Implementing feature flags
- And more!

The cookbooks are well-commented and can serve as a starting point or reference for your own applications.

## üëã Contribute

The Fusion Framework is open-source, and we welcome contributions from the developer community. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, improving the documentation, or creating a new cookbook, your contributions can help make the framework even better.
