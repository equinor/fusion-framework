### Major Changes

- [#3075](https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/pull/3075) [`8fffbfb`](https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/commit/8fffbfb12daa9748bf5290e5084cd4d409aed253) Thanks [@odinr](https://github.com/odinr)! - This release introduces a new package, `@equinor/fusion-framework-dev-portal`, as part of a refactor of the `@equinor/fusion-framework-cli`.
  The refactor moves specific functionality and code related to the development portal into its own dedicated package to improve modularity and maintainability.

  **Features**

  - Development portal for the Fusion framework
  - Support for MSAL authentication
  - Integration with service discovery
  - Environment variable configuration

  This package is a small part of the refactoring of the `@equinor/fusion-framework-cli` and while it can be used standalone, it is recommended to use the `@equinor/fusion-framework-dev-server` package for a more complete development experience.

  Additionally, this update includes improved documentation and examples for better user guidance.
