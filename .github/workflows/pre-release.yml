# This workflow creates pre-release snapshots of all packages
# It generates changeset files, updates package versions with snapshot tags,
# and publishes packages to npm with the specified tag (e.g., 'beta')
# Used for testing releases before final publication
#
# WARNING: Pre-release packages are experimental and may contain breaking changes
# WARNING: Only execute this workflow if you understand the implications of publishing pre-release packages
