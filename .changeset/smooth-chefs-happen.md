## @equinor/fusion-framework-docs

Removed an outdated warning message about React version support in the Fusion Portal getting started guide.

### Why

The warning message stated:

> The Fusion Portal only supports React@17

However, this is no longer accurate, as the Fusion Portal now supports newer versions of React beyond 17.
