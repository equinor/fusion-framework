Add new cookbook demonstrating React 19 compatible version of `@equinor/fusion-react-styles`.

This cookbook showcases:
- ThemeProvider setup and usage
- makeStyles and createStyles patterns
- Theme value access patterns (getVariable, .css, .attributes)
- Dynamic styles with props
- CSS-in-JS with classes instead of inline styles
- Automatic stylesheet cleanup on component unmount

The cookbook tests the React 19 compatible version of fusion-react-styles with Material-UI dependency removed.
