Improved all cookbook README documentation for better developer experience.

All cookbook README files now feature:
- Code examples matching actual implementations
- Inline comments explaining patterns and concepts
- Developer-friendly language for those new to Fusion Framework
- Focus on what each cookbook demonstrates rather than generic setup
- Proper TSDoc comments in code blocks
- Removed installation sections in favor of teaching patterns

This improves the learning experience for developers exploring framework features through the 18 available cookbooks.
