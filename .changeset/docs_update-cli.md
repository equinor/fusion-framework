---

- Added or updated frontmatter in all CLI documentation Markdown files (`README.md`, `docs/application.md`, `docs/auth.md`, `docs/libsecret.md`, `docs/migration-v10-to-v11.md`, `docs/portal.md`) to include accurate `title`, `description`, `category`, and comprehensive `tags` reflecting the content and CLI features.
- Synced documentation content with the latest CLI docs, ensuring all guides, migration notes, and troubleshooting sections are up-to-date.
- Removed unused or obsolete CLI documentation files (`api-authentication.md`, `commands.md`, `configuration.md`, `guide/app/cli.md`).
- Updated VuePress sidebar and theme configuration to reflect the new documentation structure and navigation.
- Removed the deprecated `/roadmap` section and its assets from the documentation site.
