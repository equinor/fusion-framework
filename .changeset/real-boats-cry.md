Aligned CLI dev-portal more to fusion classic portal layout

> the dev-portal is a generic portal for developing application, not a 100% replica of the environment _(this will be a feature in future, which the developer kan test the application in different simulated portals)_

**No functionality changed, only the markup of dev-portal**
