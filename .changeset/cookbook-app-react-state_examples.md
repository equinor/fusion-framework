🎉 Added new cookbook demonstrating state management with useAppState hook in React applications!

This comprehensive cookbook 📚 provides developers with practical examples and best practices for using the Fusion Framework state module in React applications.

The cookbook includes complete state management examples demonstrating simple state management, sharing state between components, and complex object state updates. It features interactive components including `UserProfileControls` and `UserProfileDisplay` components showing real-world state management patterns.

Key features include:
- 📖 Educational documentation with learning objectives, setup instructions, and key concepts
- 🔷 Full TypeScript implementation with proper type definitions
- ⚡ Complete development setup with dev server and build configuration

Developers will learn how to configure the state module using `enableAppState`, use the `useAppState` hook for persistent state management, share state between components with unique state keys, manage complex object state with proper update patterns, and follow best practices for organizing state in Fusion applications.

🚀 Developers can run this cookbook to learn state management patterns:

```bash
cd cookbooks/app-react-state
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This cookbook serves as a complete reference implementation 🛠️ for teams adopting the Fusion Framework state module in their React applications.
