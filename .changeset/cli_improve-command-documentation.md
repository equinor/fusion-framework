"@equinor/fusion-framework-cli": patch
---

Enhanced CLI command documentation and help text across all commands.

- Updated command examples to use `ffc` (alias) instead of `fusion-framework-cli`
- Improved TSDoc comments with comprehensive descriptions and examples
- Streamlined help text by removing redundant information and improving formatting
- Added proper @example and @remarks tags for better IntelliSense support
- Enhanced option descriptions for clarity and consistency

These changes improve the developer experience when using the CLI by providing clearer documentation and more accurate examples.

Thanks to [@estoksam](https://github.com/estoksam) for reporting the CLI command help text issues in [fusion#651](https://github.com/equinor/fusion/issues/651).
