"@fusion-framework/utils-observable": minor

- Improved the `DynamicInputValue` type in `to-observable.ts` to better support functions with arguments and ObservableInput return types.
- Updated the `toObservable` function signature for more accurate argument typing and handling.
- Renamed test file from `observable.ts` to `observable.test.ts` for consistency with test conventions.
- No breaking changes; all existing usages remain compatible.
