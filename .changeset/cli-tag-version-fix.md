**Note:** This changeset documents changes that were already implemented and released in [PR #3341](https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/pull/3341) (merged 2025-09-05) and included in the [ðŸ¤– Bip Bop - Fusion Framework Release](https://github.com/equinor/fusion-framework/pull/3342) (merged 2025-09-08). This changeset serves as a historical record and comprehensive documentation of the CLI tag command improvements, ensuring the changelog contains detailed information about the breaking changes, migration path, and technical details that may be referenced by users upgrading or troubleshooting CLI issues.

Fixed `--version` flag conflict in CLI tag commands and improved API consistency.

- **Fixed:** Resolved conflict between custom `--version` option and Commander's built-in `--version` flag that displays CLI version
- **Refactored:** Replaced separate `--appKey`/`--version` options with unified `--package name@version` syntax for both `app tag` and `portal tag` commands
- **Improved:** Enhanced error handling with clear validation messages for package format
- **Updated:** Documentation and help text to reflect new `--package` option usage
- **Added:** Better user feedback with colored logging for successful operations

**Breaking Changes:**
This introduces a breaking change to the CLI API by removing the `--version` and `--appKey` options in favor of the `--package` option. However, we're releasing this as a patch since:

1. The `--version` flag never worked properly due to the conflict with Commander's built-in version flag
2. The old API was fundamentally broken and unusable
3. Limited adoption in production environments means minimal impact
4. The same functionality is accessible through:
   - The `publish` command (recommended for standard releases)
   - The Fusion App Admin UI (graphical interface for release management)

**Migration:**
- Old: `fusion-framework-cli app tag --appKey my-app --version 1.2.3 latest`
- New: `fusion-framework-cli app tag --package my-app@1.2.3 latest`

This resolves the issue where `--version` would show CLI version (11.1.2) instead of using it as a bundle version parameter. Now `--version` correctly displays CLI version, and `--package` specifies the bundle to tag.
