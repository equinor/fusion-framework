Updated MSAL from 2.39 to 3.25

This update should not require any changes to your codebase, but it is recommended to test your application thoroughly to ensure compatibility with the new version.

we will have a major update of `@equinor/fusion-framework-module-msal` where we will have braking changes, but will align with the new version of MSAL.
