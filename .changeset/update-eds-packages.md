Update EDS (Equinor Design System) packages to latest versions: `@equinor/eds-core-react` to ^2.2.0, `@equinor/eds-icons` to ^1.1.0, `@equinor/eds-tokens` to ^2.1.1, and `@equinor/eds-utils` to ^2.0.0.

These are major version updates from the 0.x series. Consumers should verify compatibility with their applications, particularly if using `@equinor/fusion-react-side-sheet` which may require updates to support the new EDS versions.
