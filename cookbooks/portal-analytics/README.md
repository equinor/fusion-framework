# Cookbook Portal for Analytics

This cookbook demonstrates the analytics module usage in a portal.

It has a click collector, a collector for context change and a adapter to emit
the events to a log file - via the dev-server proxy.

Logs will be displayed in the portal or it can be viewed in `otel-logs/log.txt`.
